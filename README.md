# Baltimore Residence Population Trend
Research and analysis on the current trend for residence population in Baltimore City,MD

## Background
Baltimore City in Maryland currently has an estimated population of 600,000 people. The population in the United States has been gradually decreasing over the past few decades due to lower birth rates and new policies limiting immigration. I have decided to analyze to population trend in Baltimore to determine if the population in Baltimore has also been declining and predict the future population in the city based on the data sets.
